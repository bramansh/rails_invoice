#+TITLE: README

* About
  this is my test app learning to docker and to rails...
  some basic details:

  - The app simply does basic Create,Rread,Update +Delete+
  - uses env vars on database.yml(lol, that's not new either)
  - zero test cases :(

 BUT
  - is container friendly
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    docker-compose up -d && docker-compose logs -f
    #+END_SRC
  - to use in pwd
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    git clone https://github.com/thapakazi/rails_invoice
    cd rails_invoice
    docker-compose up -d
    docker-compose logs -f
    #+END_SRC
